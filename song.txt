Name: Don't Be So Shy


Take a breath
Rest your head
Close your eyes
You are right

Just lay down
Turn my side
Do you feel my heat

On your skin

Take off your clothes
Blow out the fire
Don't be so shy

You're right
You're right

Take off my clothes
Oh bless me father

Don't ask me why
You're right
You're right
